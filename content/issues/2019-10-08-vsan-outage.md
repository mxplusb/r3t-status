vSAN won't reconfigure properly, so everything is running off the two emergency disks and shit is real broken, basically just vCenter and DNS are the only things online while I figure out wtf is wrong with it.



This means pretty much everything is down. Well, there's no pretty much about it, shit's broken yo.
